== Webcounters ==

Ever since we have websites, we have the discussion what constitutes a `hit`. 
Having been a website operator since the earliest days, it is my conviction that `hits` are a futile 
measure, even for sites that generate income with ads. Page views, hits, unique visitors all these measures
have problems. Since I am  schooled in statistics and data gathering, I think I have a point.
This widget shows exactly the futility if it :-)
